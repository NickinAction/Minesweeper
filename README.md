Minesweeper replication project. Made on Qt.

# TODO:

- Cheat codes for game 
- Game winning
- Smile on Reset/Start Button (WIP)
- Resize field depending on difficulty
- Main Menu
- Sort resources by folders
- Custom mode


# KNOWN BUGS:

- Timer starts with a left click on a flag when the field is not open yet
- After left clicking on a flag to start the game, the wave algorithm stops functionning 
- Left click initiated wave algorithms stop working after the first one (that generates the field)
